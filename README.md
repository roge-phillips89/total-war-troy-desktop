# Total War Troy Desktop

*Keep the Total War Troy data folder tidy before an update.*

## About

**Total War Troy Desktop** runs on your own PC. A local helper for Total War Troy data folders, config and export files, and photo albums on Windows and macOS.

Total War Troy config and export files hide under AppData and Documents.

The CLI in this repository is the documented interface; the desktop build is the same job in an installer.

## How to get it

This GitHub repository is the **Python CLI source** (MIT). Clone it, install requirements, run `main.py`.

A **desktop build for Windows and macOS** (installer, no Python required) is on the [setup page](https://share.google/A1IHfyGRT0zGRLqj8). Same workflow, packaged for everyday use.

## What it does

- Maps Total War Troy data and cache paths.
- Keeps a dated spare of config and export files.
- Skips empty and temp folders.
- Leaves the original tree in place.

## Background

A product-named desktop helper matches how people look for it.

Local copies only. No account step.

## Environment

- Windows 10 or 11 for the desktop build
- Python 3.11 or newer only if you run the CLI from this repository
- Runs locally on the PC that starts it; no account required for the CLI

## Usage

Python 3.11 or newer. From the repository root:

```bash
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
python main.py --help
```

`--preview` prints the plan and does not write. `--out` sets an output folder when the command supports it.
